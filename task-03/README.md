## Overview

In this task, I implemented solutions of four problems in various programming languages. The languages included are Python, Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript, Java, Go, C, C++, Rust, and Haskell.

## Implementation Details

### Python

Python was the language I was most familiar with, so implementing the solutions was straightforward. I utilized Python’s syntax and features to complete the task efficiently.

### Other Languages

For languages other than Python, such as Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript, Java, Go, C, C++, Rust, and Haskell, I was relatively new to them. I haven’t studied these languages in-depth but relied on my logic and online resources to understand and apply their syntax. Here’s how I approached it:

- **Ruby**: Referenced online resources to understand loop syntax and basic constructs.
- **Elixir**: Used Google to find syntax for loops and function definitions.
- **JavaScript**: Consulted documentation for syntax and common practices.
- **Java**: Looked up syntax for loops and basic Java constructs.
- **Go**: Checked online examples for Go loop syntax and conventions.
- **C**: Referenced C language documentation for loop structures and syntax.
- **C++**: Used online resources to understand C++ specific syntax and constructs.
- **Rust**: Consulted Rust documentation for loop syntax and language features.
- **Haskell**: Used online examples and Haskell documentation for functional programming constructs.

## Conclusion

This task provided me with valuable exposure to new programming languages. While Python was familiar, working with other languages required me to use my logic and look up syntax online. This process was a great learning experience and helped me improve my problem-solving skills.
