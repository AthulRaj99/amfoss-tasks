This was one of the hardest tasks I've done. I had everything go smoothly till the rebooting part. After restarting, when I would reach the window to install, it always showed me that I needed to disable bitlocker in Windows, so I did exactly 
that. But the same thing happened after that. So I chose to update the installer which was another option. It is also the reason why I did all the tasks in Ubuntu, main reason being the threats made by my mentors xD.But after installing it I
reallly enjoyed the outlook of the Ubuntu(pun intended).
