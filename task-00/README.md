This turned out to be one of the most challenging tasks I’ve faced. Everything was going smoothly until I hit the reboot stage. After restarting, I kept encountering a message at the installation window that required me to disable BitLocker in Windows. I followed the instructions, but the problem persisted. So, I decided to update the installer, which was the only other option available. This experience led me to complete all the tasks in Ubuntu, mainly due to the “warnings” from my mentors, xD! But after finally getting it installed, I have to say, I really enjoyed Ubuntu’s interface.
