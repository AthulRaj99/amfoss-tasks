try my leve best to bring a change in the  club with my own contributions.

I will always try to be accessible to the club whatever be the event or project.I will also try 
to share the knowledge that i got to other club members and help them in whatever ways possible.
#3 WHAT ARE YOUR FIELDS OF INTEREST,AND HOW DO YOU PLAN ON WORKING ON THEM?
Right now I have only heard more about web dev which is not that much.But whatever I heard seemed 
fascinating to me.I would love to learn more about other fields and try to build something on my own
which has always been my primary reason to get into coding.
